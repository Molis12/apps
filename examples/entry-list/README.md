# Entry List location example
This example shows how an app with a `EntryList` location can be built. It creates a simple handler that retrieves the id of the entry and return it to be displayed on the entries table.

## How to use

Install it and run:

```bash
npm install
npm start
# or
yarn
yarn start
```

To test, you can create an app definition in your Contentful organization settings pointing to `http://localhost:1234` and registering the `entry-list` locations.
