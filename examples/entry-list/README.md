# Entry List location example
This example shows how to build an app with an `EntryList` location. It creates a simple handler that retrieves the entry id and returns it to display on the entries table.

## How to use

Install it and run:

```bash
npm install
npm start
# or
yarn
yarn start
```

To test, you can create an app definition in your Contentful organization settings pointing to `http://localhost:3000` and registering the `entry-list` locations.
